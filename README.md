# MyJwtAuthIntegration
Project Name: MyJwtAuthIntegration

Overview:
MyJwtAuthIntegration is a Spring Boot-based application designed to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It provides a secure authentication mechanism for users, utilizing JWTs for stateless authentication across services. This project integrates both access tokens and refresh tokens to handle user authentication efficiently, ensuring scalability and security in web applications.

Key Features:
	1.	JWT Token Generation:
	•	Users authenticate using their credentials (e.g., username and password) to receive a signed JWT access token and refresh token.
	2.	Access Token Validation:
	•	The system verifies the access token to allow or deny access to protected endpoints.
	3.	Refresh Token Flow:
	•	Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
	4.	Spring Security Integration:
	•	Integrated with Spring Security for securing endpoints and validating JWTs.
	5.	User Authentication and Authorization:
	•	Ensures secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to different resources based on user roles.

Technologies Used:
	•	Spring Boot: For creating the backend application.
	•	Spring Security: For securing REST endpoints.
	•	JWT: For generating and validating authentication tokens.
	•	H2 Database (or MySQL): For storing user data (credentials, roles).

Usage:
	•	This project can be used as a base for secure REST API services where user authentication is required without maintaining session states.
	•	It’s ideal for applications where stateless authentication is crucial (e.g., microservices architecture or distributed systems).

This project can also be extended by adding functionalities like OAuth2 integration, user roles, or JWT expiration management.
